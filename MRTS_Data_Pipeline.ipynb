Notwithstanding seasonal effects, estimated retail sales recovered by increasing by 50% between the dip in April 2020 and December 2020, and by that time retail sales had surpassed all previous monthly totals in the observed period.\n",

The estimated sales of 'Used car dealers' recoved with the least strentgh, increasing by 47% from USD 6,504m in April 2020 to USD 9,568m in December 2020."
